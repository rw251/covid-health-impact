Use algorithm to exclude reviews from JUST prevalence

For cardiovascular I went with all the QOF categories. They are: AF, CHD, HF, HTN, PAD, Stroke (split into stroke and non-haemorrhagic stroke) and TIA. Is that a sensible list - any others? The only other I could think of was angina - should that be included?
For respiratory (which we weren't sure whether to include or not) I've just done asthma and COPD. If we start doing things like pneumonia then we get the issue with overlapping with COVID-19 symptoms. Thoughts? Any others I could add in?
